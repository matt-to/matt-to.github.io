                    <p>My interest in transportation began when I joined the YMCA-NYS Safe Routes Ambassador Program in May 2019. I am also the President of the Safe Routes Club,
                        focused on improving local pedestrian transportation. I have led multiple community events to evaluate local walking conditions and met with officials to

                        student representatives on my school district’s Reopening Task Force to plan the return to school post lockdown, with my area of responsibility
